## Hello there, fellow *Homo sapiens*! 

### Bio

I'm Gustavo, a biologist that decided that coding could help doing biology stuff. 

My journey in the field of programming began in 2016 when I started my master's and had to deal with lots of data, coupled with heavy statistical analysis. Thus, my R programming journey began! 

### Current Work

At the moment I'm on the second year of my PhD, following along the research started way back 2016: Species Distribution Modeling. The goal is to better understand how to approach this type of analysis, helping fellow biologists develop better models that could help plan for species conservation and corelated ecological studies.

### Other Projects

As an avid learner, I always try to find myself new things to tinker with, so here's a couple projects I'm working on:

- developing my own website using R and the package blogdown, where I'll share tutorials and guides regarding the R language, translated to Brazilian Portuguese.

- collaborating as a webdeveloper of the Geology and Natural Sciences Museum website, maintained by the Department of Biological Sciences, São Paulo State University - UNESP.

- collaborating as a data analist for the Portuguese-English Verb Dictionary project, maintained by the Lexicon Study Research Group (GPEL), Department of Modern Languages, São Paulo State University - UNESP.

- building an app to identify succulents through photos with Python.

- developing a Latin sentence analyser with Python.
